# Deep Learning Essentials 🚀

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Essentials**, a comprehensive collection of notebooks and algorithms that explore various aspects of deep learning. This repository is designed to serve as both a learning resource and a practical tool for deep learning enthusiasts, professionals, and students alike.

The notes and notebooks included here are inspired by lectures from **@IIT Madras**, **@IIT Bombay**, and **@Statquest**, making them a valuable resource for understanding key deep learning concepts taught by world-renowned faculty. 🎓

## Repository Structure 📁

The repository is organized into three main folders, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning:

### 1. **PyTorch Notebooks** (`pytorch/`) 🔥

This folder contains hands-on examples and tutorials related to PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. You'll find examples covering:
- Neural network architectures 🧠
- Training pipelines 🏋️‍♂️
- Custom datasets 📊
- Model evaluation ✅
- And much more!

These notebooks will help you understand PyTorch's dynamic computational graph and how to use it effectively in deep learning research and projects.

### 2. **TensorFlow Notebooks** (`tensorflow/`) 🌐

In this folder, you'll find notebooks focusing on TensorFlow, another widely-used framework in the deep learning community. The notebooks cover:
- Building deep neural networks 🏗️
- Implementing transfer learning 🔄
- Distributed training 📡
- Model serving and deployment with TensorFlow 🚀

TensorFlow is highly versatile and used in production environments, making these notebooks invaluable for both learning and applying deep learning in real-world applications.

### 3. **Algorithms from Scratch** (`optimization/`) 🛠️

This folder includes implementations of fundamental optimization algorithms and neural network components built from scratch. Some of the algorithms covered include:
- Gradient Descent (and its variants) 🏃‍♂️
- Backpropagation 🔄
- Optimization techniques like Adam, RMSProp, etc. ⚙️

By understanding these algorithms at a fundamental level, you'll gain deeper insights into how deep learning models are trained and optimized.
